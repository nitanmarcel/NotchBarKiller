# TopNotch-NotchKiller
Simple Magisk Module that will replace your `framework-res__auto_generated.apk` file in `/system/vendor/overlays`

Replacing this .apk will allow your phone to Ignore the fact that it has a notch and fill the space ("Kill" the notch)

This works specifically in vertical fullscreen apps, such as Instagram, Snapchat, Yahoo Weather, etc.

Fullscreen applications such as Netflix and YouTube both still recognize your device has an abnormal aspect ratio and you can still zoom in to fill the video or leave it as is.
