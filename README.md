# TopNotch-NotchKiller
Simple Magisk Module that will replace your `framework-res__auto_generated.apk` file in `/system/vendor/overlays`

Replacing this .apk will allow your phone to Ignore the fact that it has a notch and fill the space ("Kill" the notch)

This works specifically in vertical fullscreen apps as well as games, such as Instagram, Snapchat, Yahoo Weather, PUBG mobile, etc.

Fullscreen applications such as Netflix and YouTube both still recognize your device has an abnormal aspect ratio and you can still zoom in to fill the video or leave it as is.

THIS MOD HAS ONLY BEEN TESTED AND VERIFIED TO WORK ON THE ESSENTIAL PH-1 (Mata)

After: https://imgur.com/a/aVkn9Xl (Phone no longer acknowledges the notch, and fills the space correctly.)
